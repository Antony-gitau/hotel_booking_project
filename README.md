# Hotel booking project	

The aim of the project is to train a model to predict how likely it is for a customer to cancel their hotel booking. 

## The steps I followed in the process:
 
 Data cleaning
 - Replaced missing data with 0

Analysing data
 - renaming colummns into quickly readable form.
 - distribution analysis using boxplots and heatmaps
 - reindexing data according to time (months, days)

Training the model
 - checking correlation
 - selcting features
 - training with logistic regression, KNN, Decision trees, Naive bayes, & Random forest
